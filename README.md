Interfaces

A data structure is a collection of values and operations associated with that collection. An abstract data type is a logical view, or a model, of a data type or data structure. In Java, we represent an ADT as an interface.

We will learn about many ADTs and data structures this semester. In this module, we'll learn about interfaces, the client perspective, and two ADTs: bag and list.
